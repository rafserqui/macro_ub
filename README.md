# Macroeconomics II

This is the repository with the material for the first part of the class. I have borrowed material from many sources. In particular, [Eric Sims --- Graduate Macro Theory II](https://www3.nd.edu/~esims1/grad_macro_17.html). I also use several books and other sources listed in the syllabus.
